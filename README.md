Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.
Difficulties I faced:
Well, first of all, pygame. I found it quite unintuitive, with many, many,many things to memorize. To the point where in my initial code that followed the tutorial, I had a comment on almost every single line with notes and structures. Second, the initial tutorial used functions in a while loop that keeps updating. This method requires an abudance of global variables (which is apparently bad coding habits). So, some time later, the same creator uploaded a video of himself fundamentally morphing the nature an philosophy of his code: class-oriented progrmming. Now this, was entirely new to me, for we have not learned this in class. Therefore, I also struggled a lot with adding new things. Even though I encountered issues with things that required changing fundamentals on how the opponent interacts with the game, I still managed to increase the opponent speed, add my own sounds, and change many of the colors.
The stuff I managed to change:
window size to fit my laptop,
paddle and ball ratios
colors
sounds

Even though there's no rainbow, I think i still managed to produce an aesthetically pleasing game that works well :)
